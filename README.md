<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

## üìö Introduction

<b>YelpCamp</b> is a website for publishing reviews about campgrounds. You can add, modify, or remove campground postings, as well as view and leave reviews for postings created by others.

This project was created as part of the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Colt">Colt Steele</a>.

I took this course because I had prior front-end/back-end knowledge but wasn't quite sure how to connect all the pieces, let alone host an app online for anyone to use. My goal was to learn how to create full-stack applications that could be used by anyone.

In building YelpCamp, the individual technologies I learned were combined into a single, deployable application. It features RESTful routes as well as basic security implementation. I was surprised by how easily a lot of things could be simplified as long as you had the right tools or knew where to look. This project is far from perfect and I have so much more to learn, but it's a start. ‚úåÔ∏è
