<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## üìö Introduction
<b>YelpCamp</b> is a website for publishing reviews about campgrounds. You can add, modify, or remove campground postings, as well as view and leave reviews for postings created by others.

This project was created as part of the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Colt">Colt Steele</a>. I took this course because I had prior front-end/back-end knowledge but wasn't quite sure how to connect all the pieces, let alone host an app online for anyone to use.

<b>My goal was to learn how to create applications that could be used by anyone.</b>

In building YelpCamp, these individual technologies were combined into a single, deployable application. I also learned how to design RESTful routes, utilize a variety of helpful modules, and implement basic security procedures. I was surprised by how easily a lot of things could be simplified as long as you had the right tools or knew where to look. This project is far from perfect and I have so much more to learn, but it's a start and it has certainly given me the essentials to start building more applications in the future. ‚úåÔ∏è

## üíò Contributing
I tend to document my code extensively as I'm learning new things (mainly so I can use it as a reference) so if you find any issues or have suggestions - whether it's fixing a typo, simplifying a piece of code, improving an explanation, or adhering to best practice guidelines - it's all greatly appreciated!
